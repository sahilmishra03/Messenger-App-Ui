# 📱 Messenger UI Clone (Home Screen) - Flutter

This is a simple UI clone of the **Messenger Home Screen**, built using **Flutter**. The goal of this project was to practice Flutter layout widgets and mimic the sleek design of a modern chat app interface.

## ✨ Features

- Messenger-style home screen layout
- Avatar display for stories
- Recent chats list with profile, name, message preview, and time
- Responsive and clean UI design

> ⚠️ This project is UI-only — no backend or navigation is implemented.
